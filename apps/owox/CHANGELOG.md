![OWOX Data Marts - v0.11.0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2365a8a6-c9a0-4b7a-8b85-30d57aae2434)

- 7617b79: # Enhanced Data Mart run history monitoring with automatic updates

  Improved the overall experience when working with Data Mart by introducing automatic data refresh and better run handling:

  **Automatic data updates:**
  - Run history now automatically refreshes, keeping you informed about the latest execution status
  - Google Sheets reports automatically update with fresh data without manual page refresh
  - Auto-refresh can be toggled on/off in run history, with your preference saved for future sessions
  - Updates happen silently in the background without disrupting your work

  **Better connector run experience:**
  - Clear loading indicators when manually running connectors, with the ability to cancel
  - Improved error messages when attempting to run a connector that's already in progress
  - No more technical error messages - you'll see friendly notifications like "Connector is already running. Please wait until it finishes"

  These improvements ensure you always have up-to-date information about your Data Mart executions without needing to manually refresh the page.

- 0a99a0b: # Add ability to copy connector configuration from existing Data Marts

  Added a new feature that allows users to copy connector configuration settings from existing Data Marts when creating or editing connector-based Data Marts.
  - **Copy configuration button**: New dropdown menu in the connector configuration step that shows all Data Marts with the same connector type
  - **Multi-configuration support**: For Data Marts with multiple configurations, a nested menu allows selecting specific configuration
  - **Configuration preview**: Tooltip on each item shows required fields with masked secrets
  - **Secure secret copying**: Secrets are properly masked and merged from source on backend

- 5cd552c: # Improve Data Mart Creation Flow and Connector Editor Experience

  This update brings several enhancements to the Data Mart creation flow and connector-related components, improving UI consistency, usability, and workflow efficiency.

  **Changes**
  - **Data Mart creation flow**:
    - Added new icons for Facebook Ads, X Ads, and LinkedIn Ads
    - Updated Empty Data Marts state with options to create Data Marts in different modes
    - Improved **DataMartDefinitionSettings** to handle mode-based initialization
    - Enhanced **CreateDataMartPage** to set default titles based on selected mode
    - Added animations on the Empty Data Marts page for a smoother user experience
  - **UX improvements**: implemented auto-open logic for Connector Setup Sheet when selecting a definition type
  - **UI improvements**: updated theme handling in **DataMartCodeEditor** for consistent styling

- c929eb0: # Fix BigQuery data duplication with NULL in unique keys

  Fixed MERGE query in BigQueryStorage to correctly handle NULL values in unique key columns using `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` instead of `=`. This prevents duplicate records when fields like `AssetGroupId` are NULL.

- ccb4fef: # Fix Boolean type in Connector Data Mart configuration

  Fixed an issue with boolean field types in connector configurations when setting up data marts.
  This fix ensures that boolean fields in connector configurations are properly handled, making them interactive and displaying appropriate UI indicators regardless of their default values.

- 6059657: # Fixed connector configuration fields editing

  Fixed an issue where connector configuration fields with default values were difficult to edit when setting up a data mart.
  Fields now properly handle user input and allow modification of default values.

- 7617b79: # Improved SQL validation flow in Data Marts to prevent timeout issues

  Previously, users were unable to save SQL queries in Data Marts when validation took longer than 30 seconds, causing timeout errors.

  This update resolves the issue by:
  - Made SQL validation asynchronous and non-blocking for saving SQL in Input Sources
  - SQL validation is no longer required for Publishing Data Marts

  Users can now save SQL queries regardless of validation time, improving the overall experience when working with complex queries or large datasets.

- 7617b79: # Fix messages for Data Mart publish button

  Improved the clarity of status messages displayed on the Data Mart publish button.
  You'll now see more accurate and informative feedback when publishing your Data Marts.

- f96f9aa: # Add Google Ads connector

  Added new Google Ads connector with Service Account authentication

  Available data nodes:
  - `campaigns`, `campaigns_stats` - Campaign data
  - `ad_groups`, `ad_groups_stats` - Ad group data
  - `ad_group_ads_stats` - Ad performance data
  - `keywords_stats` - Keyword performance data
  - `criterion` - Criteria data

- b11b726: # Added support for oneOf fields with recursive secret masking

  This release adds comprehensive support for oneOf configuration fields with nested secret handling. The connector secret service now recursively masks and merges secret fields within oneOf structures, ensuring sensitive data like API keys and tokens in nested authentication configurations are properly protected.

  New UI components include ButtonGroup for value-based selection and AppWizardCollapsible for expandable sections. Fixed an issue where the wrong oneOf variant was pre-selected when editing existing configurations.

  Added Advanced Fields section to the connector configuration form, allowing users to configure advanced settings for the connector.

- 1b97886: # Remove MaxFetchingDays parameter and improve incremental fetching logic

  Removed the `MaxFetchingDays` parameter from all data source connectors. The incremental data fetching now works as follows:
  - **First run (no state)**: Data fetching starts from the 1st of the previous month
  - **Subsequent runs**: Data is fetched from the `LastRequestedDate` (with `ReimportLookbackWindow` applied) up to today
  - **Manual backfill**: Continues to work as before, fetching data for the specified date range

![OWOX Data Marts - v0.10.0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09ec0e4e-428a-4ac2-bded-cd056886367d)

- 7b8747c: # Fix incremental state management for multiple connector configurations

  Fixed an issue where incremental updates only saved state for the last configuration when a Data Mart had 2+ connector configurations. Now each configuration's state is tracked separately using its `_id`. Also enhanced logging with structured metadata (dataMartId, projectId, runId, configId).

  **Changes:**
  - Updated state structure to support array of states per configuration: `{at, states: [{_id, state, at}]}`
  - Modified `ConnectorStateService` to handle `configId` parameter for getting and updating state
  - Updated `ConnectorExecutionService` to extract and pass `configId` from configuration
  - Added database migration to transform existing state data from old to new format
  - Enhanced logging with structured metadata (dataMartId, projectId, runId, configId)

- 526abdc: # Improved Connector Setup and Usability Enhancements
  - Simplified the connector setup flow with a cleaner layout and improved step structure
  - Added **keyboard shortcuts** for faster field selection in the Connector Editor (Command + Shift + A on macOS, Control + Shift + A on Windows)
  - Refined default titles and interface texts for better clarity
  - Adjusted side sheet layouts for more consistent visuals

- 2898354: # Improved environment variable logging
  - Reduced verbose logging from EnvManager that was confusing users with unnecessary technical details about environment variable processing.
  - Environment setup now shows only essential information instead of detailed variable counts and processing steps.

- 3370b36: # Added migration to rename Bing Ads connector to Microsoft Ads
  - Fixed an issue where Run History tab was not displaying history if the user previously used the Bing Ads connector.

- Fixed Looker Studio Connector error with deleted Data Marts.

- 701a05f: # Add System Theme Option to User Menu
  - Added **System** option to the theme switcher for automatic theme selection.
  - Enhanced **UserMenu** with theme selection and submenu support for better usability.

- 54df91e: # Convert boolean parameters to proper boolean type

  Updated boolean configuration parameters to use proper `boolean` type instead of `string` or `bool` types:
  - **ProcessShortLinks** (FacebookMarketing): `string` → `boolean`
  - **SandboxMode** (TikTokAds): `bool` → `boolean`
  - **IncludeDeleted** (TikTokAds): `bool` → `boolean`

- 8402b05: # Add new CLI commands for database migrations

  - Improved Combobox component with better search functionality using keywords and increased minimum width for better display of longer location names.

- 43adfcb: # Split Facebook Marketing insights endpoint into three separate endpoints
  - Split `ad-account/insights` into three endpoints: base insights, insights by country, and insights by link URL asset
  - Added `ad-account/insights-by-country` endpoint with country breakdown
  - Added `ad-account/insights-by-link-url-asset` endpoint with link_url_asset breakdown
  - Refactored insights data fetching to use object parameters and separate fields from breakdowns
  - **⚠️ Breaking Changes:** `ad-account/insights` endpoint no longer supports breakdown fields
  - **⚠️ Breaking Changes:** if your data mart was using `ad-account/insights` with breakdown fields (e.g., country, link_url_asset), you need to recreate it using the appropriate new endpoint:
    - Use `ad-account/insights-by-country` for country breakdown
    - Use `ad-account/insights-by-link-url-asset` for link URL asset breakdown

- 646511d: # Fix data mart run history time logs

- 19c21a1: # ⚠️ Breaking Change: LinkedIn Authentication Update

  **What changed:**
  LinkedIn connectors now require **3 credentials** instead of 1 Access Token: Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token.

  **What you need to do:**
  1. Go to [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://developer.linkedin.com/) → your app → **Auth** tab
  2. Copy these 3 values:
     - **Client ID** (top of Auth page)
     - **Client Secret** (top of Auth page)
     - **Refresh Token** (generate via OAuth 2.0 tools)

  **How to update:**
  1. Go to your OWOX Data Marts
  2. Find your LinkedIn connector configuration
  3. Enter the 3 new credentials instead of the old Access Token:
     - **Client ID**
     - **Client Secret**
     - **Refresh Token**

- b41b62d: # Logging System Architecture Refactor
  - **Refactored logging architecture**: Extracted Pino logger creation from LoggerFactory into a provider-agnostic architecture while maintaining backward compatibility
  - **Simplified configuration**: Removed `environment` presets from LoggerConfig, now only `LogLevel` controls logging behavior
  - **Environment variables update**:
    - Changed from `LOG_LEVELS` (comma-separated) to `LOG_LEVEL` (threshold-based)
    - Updated `.env.example` with clear documentation
  - **Enhanced TypeORM integration**: Improved `CustomDataSourceLogger` with proper parameter usage and context formatting

  **Breaking Changes:**
  - `LOG_LEVELS` environment variable renamed to `LOG_LEVEL`
  - Removed `environment` field from `LoggerConfig` interface

  **Migration:**
  - Replace `LOG_LEVELS=log,warn,error` with `LOG_LEVEL=info` (threshold-based) or app will use default `info` level
  - Remove `environment` parameter from LoggerFactory calls

- 8a1ef12: # Secure MySQL connections (TLS/SSL)
  - New, simple way to enable encrypted MySQL connections via environment variables:
    - Backend (NestJS/TypeORM): `DB_SSL`
    - Identity provider (Better Auth): `IDP_BETTER_AUTH_MYSQL_SSL`

  - **idp-better-auth** uses the `DB_*` environment variables unless `IDP_BETTER_AUTH_MYSQL_*` is specified.

- fc17562: # Enhance Error Handling and Notifications
  - Enhanced **API error handling** and notifications across components.
  - Updated **Toaster** component styles for improved clarity and consistency.
  - Other UI improvements

- af2e412: # Updated Google BigQuery & Google Sheets authentication
  - Switched to JWT-based auth client (`google-auth-library`).
  - Removed deprecated credential paths and warnings.
  - Improved reliability of loads/queries.
  - No action required — existing service account JSON keys continue to work.

- 58e2ead: # Updated Looker Studio data destination
  - Clarify `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`: base public URL of the application (scheme + host [+ optional port]).
    - Examples: `http://localhost:3000`, `https://data-marts.example.com`
    - Default: `http://localhost:${PORT}`
    - In production, set this to your actual deployment URL.
  - Introduce `LOOKER_STUDIO_DESTINATION_ORIGIN`: public origin used to generate the deployment URL for the Looker Studio destination.
    - If empty, it falls back to `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`.
    - Example: `https://looker.example.com`

  Heads up
  - When retrieving the current JSON config for a Looker Studio Data Destination, the `deploymentUrl` field is now generated from `LOOKER_STUDIO_DESTINATION_ORIGIN` (fallback: `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`). If you previously set `deploymentUrl` manually during creation, it is now populated from the environment variable values.

  UI Updates: Triggers Table and Reports Table
  - Minor UI updates to the Triggers Table
  - UI improvements to the Reports Table for consistency

  More Friendly and Consistent Forms

  We’ve improved the interface to make working with forms in OWOX Data Marts more intuitive and user-friendly.
  - Unified form layout. All forms — for Triggers, Reports, Storage, and Destinations — now share a consistent design. This makes it easier to navigate and work with confidence.
  - Helpful hints where you need them. Tooltips and inline descriptions have been added next to form fields, so you can better understand what’s expected without second-guessing.
  - Improved tooltip styling. Tooltips now feature a more noticeable background, making important information easier to spot.
  - Faster editing. You can now enter edit mode in the Storage and Destinations tables with a single click on a row — no need to hunt for buttons.
  - Warnings before leaving with unsaved changes. If you make changes to a Storage or Destination and try to leave without saving, you’ll see a confirmation dialog — helping prevent accidental data loss.

  Refined Data Mart Page: Layout, Menu, and Texts
  - Updated the layout of the Connector block
  - Polished the dropdown menu on the Data Mart page

  Redesigned "Create Data Mart" Page
  - The form on the Create Data Mart page has been updated for visual consistency and a better user experience.

  Extra Visual and Text Tweaks
  - We’ve also made a few small improvements to the UI and copy to make everything feel more polished and cohesive.
