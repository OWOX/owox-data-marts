# Email destination — transitional note

- Currently, the Email destination uses the common logic that is shared by four destination types:
  - EMAIL
  - SLACK
  - MS_TEAMS
  - GOOGLE_CHAT
- In the future, all destination types except Email are expected to receive their own type‑specific implementations and be extracted from here.

This README clarifies the current transitional state until those extractions are completed.
