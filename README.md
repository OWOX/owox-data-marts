## ✨ Why We Built This

Data analysts’ work means nothing unless business users can play with the data freely.

However, most **self-service analytics** initiatives fail because they compromise either the data analysts’ control or the business users’ freedom.

At OWOX, we value both:

- Data analysts **orchestrate data marts** defined either by [SQL](./docs/getting-started/setup-guide/sql-data-mart.md) or by [connectors](./docs/getting-started/setup-guide/connector-data-mart.md) to sources like Facebook Ads, TikTok Ads, and LinkedIn Ads.
- Business users **enjoy trusted reports** right [where they want them](./docs/destinations/manage-destinations.md) — in spreadsheets or dashboards.

At OWOX, we believe data analysts shouldn’t have to waste time on CSV files and one-off dashboards. Business users shouldn’t have to be forced to use complex BI tools either.

## 🚀 What You Can Do with OWOX Data Marts

### 📘 Create a Data Mart Library

Bring together data from your warehouse (BigQuery, Snowflake, etc.), APIs, or spreadsheets – and turn it into fast, reusable artifacts that you can manage & share:

- Connectors to any marketing, financial, or CRM data that you can collect into **AWS Athena** or **Google BigQuery** (more supported DWHs are being developed as you read this)
- Custom SQL
- Tables & views
- Table patterns (eg, events_2025\*)

### 📤 Deliver Trusted Data Anywhere

Connect your Data Marts to Google Sheets, Looker Studio, or Excel – empowering business teams with reports they need to make decisions.

### 🧾 Define a Semantic Layer

Document KPIs and metrics once, and keep every dashboard, pivot table, and report in sync with the same numbers & logic behind calculations – no matter the tool.

### 📅 Automate Everything

Use the advanced scheduler to refresh both Data Marts and exports at any time, fully automated and managed from a single place
