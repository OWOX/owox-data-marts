## Step 1: Configure the connector

To initiate the data import process from TikTok Ads, begin by creating a copy of a [**TikTok Ads → Google Sheets Template**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15AujaJ_x-ibEqs2u3DwvC8qV0hYC7oO1b1LGLEen1mQ/copy)

Once you have copied the template, proceed with the configuration steps:

1. In your newly copied spreadsheet, navigate to the "Config" sheet and add the **Advertiser ID**

You can easily locate your **Advertiser ID** on the left-hand navigation bar within your [TikTok for Business dashboard](https://ads.tiktok.com/).

Copy the Advertiser ID and paste it into the designated field in your spreadsheet:

## Step 2: Select Fields to Import

Several common data fields are pre-selected by default. To include additional fields in your import, go to the "Fields" tab and check the boxes next to the desired fields.

## Step 3: Run connector

Now you have **two options** for importing TikTok Ads data:

### Option 1: Import Current Day's Data

Choose **OWOX → Import New Data** to load data for the **current day**.

> ℹ️ If you click **Import New Data** again after a successful initial load,  
> the connector will import: **Current day's data**, plus **Additional days**, based on the value in the **Reimport Lookback Window** field.

### Option 2: Manual Backfill for Specific Date Range

Choose **Manual Backfill** to load historical data for a custom time range.

1. Select the **Start Date** and **End Date**  
2. Click the **Run Manual Backfill** button

The process is complete when the **Log** field shows the message:  
**"Import is finished"**  

Finally, your data will appear in new tabs labeled with the corresponding API endpoint types.  

To import more data:

1. Select the additional fields you need in the **Fields** tab.
2. Go to **OWOX → Import New Data** or **OWOX → Run Manual Backfill** again.

## Step 4: Schedule Your Connector

- **Daily Schedule:** To set up an automatic daily import, select "OWOX" > "Schedule" > "Set Daily Schedule"
- **Hourly Schedule:** To configure an automatic hourly import, select "OWOX" > "Schedule" > "Set Hourly Schedule"
- **Remove Schedules:** To disable all existing scheduled runs, select "OWOX" > "Schedule" > "Delete All Schedules"
