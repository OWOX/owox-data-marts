# Insights: Improved permission handling and read-only mode

We've enhanced how permissions work within Insights to provide a more seamless and informative experience.

- **Read-only state**: You can now view Insights in a read-only mode when you don't have edit permissions.
- **Action enforcement**: Buttons and actions (like editing or deleting) are now properly disabled based on your access level.
- **Better feedback**: New tooltips and messages explain why certain actions are restricted, helping you understand your permission levels at a glance.
