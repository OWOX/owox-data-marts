# Add "Open Query Editor" link for AWS Redshift storages

Add a direct link to the AWS Redshift Query Editor v2 console from the storage view. Clicking "Open Query Editor v2 in AWS Redshift" opens the SQL Workbench for the configured AWS region, similar to the existing console links for BigQuery, Athena, and Snowflake.
