# Safer and Smoother Connector Editing Experience

We’ve made it easier — and safer — to edit your connector settings.  
Now, if you make changes and try to close the form before saving, you’ll see a confirmation dialog to prevent losing your work.  

We’ve also simplified how configuration details are managed and improved tooltips for better clarity — so you can focus on setting up your data connections with confidence and less friction.
