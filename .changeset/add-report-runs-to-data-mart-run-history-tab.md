# Enhanced Run History: Google Sheets Reports and Looker Studio Data Fetching

The Run History tab now displays all Data Mart runs in one place:

- Google Sheets Export report runs and Looker Studio report runs are now tracked in Run History alongside Connector runs
- Each run shows its title, connector logo or destination icon, start datetime, and trigger type (manual/scheduled)
- Hover over start time to see detailed start/finish datetimes and execution duration
- Added "Pending" status for queued operations
- **All historical Runs before the update are considered manual**
