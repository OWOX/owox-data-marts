âœ¨ Google Tag Manager integration

- ðŸš€ Added Google Tag Manager support across the web app. Enable by setting `GOOGLE_TAG_MANAGER_CONTAINER_ID` in your environment. This allows nonâ€‘technical teams to ship marketing/analytics tags without deployments.

Why this matters
- ðŸ“Š Faster iteration on analytics and marketing experiments (no code release required for common changes).
