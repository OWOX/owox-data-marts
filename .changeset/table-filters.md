# Table Filters for Data Marts and Data Storages

We’ve overhauled the table filtering experience to help you navigate large datasets with precision and speed.

## Filter with logical conditions

Build complex queries effortlessly. You can now apply multiple filters simultaneously using intuitive operators:

- **Equals / Doesn't equal**
- **Contains / Doesn't contain**

## Persistent filter states

Your workflow is no longer interrupted by navigation. Applied filters are **automatically saved**, meaning they stay active when you switch between pages or return to the platform later.

## Shareable, deep-linked views

The table’s state is now reflected directly in the **page URL**. You can bookmark specific views or share links with teammates, ensuring everyone sees the exact same filtered data instantly.

## At-a-glance status

- **Active Count:** The filter button now displays a badge showing exactly how many filters are currently applied.
- **Unified UI:** Enjoy a consistent filtering interface across all Data Marts and Data Storages for a more predictable workflow.
