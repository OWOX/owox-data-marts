# Show Connector State in Manual Run

- In Manual Run → State Info for incremental runs, you can now view the Connector State.
- For connectors with multiple configurations, the state is shown for each configuration with a "Created at" tooltip.
- If no state is available, we show "No state available".
- The state is displayed as read-only JSON with a copy option.

This helps you quickly understand where incremental loading will continue from and simplifies troubleshooting.
