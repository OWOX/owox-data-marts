# AWS Redshift documentation improvements

- Restructured the setup guide into 4 clear steps with a new introductory paragraph
- Added annotated screenshots covering every stage: storage selection, region and title, workgroup/cluster lookup, database identification, IAM key creation, permissions policy, and saving the configuration
- Moved the "Database Name" field after connection type selection to match the natural AWS Console lookup order
- Consolidated IAM credential instructions (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) into a single streamlined section
