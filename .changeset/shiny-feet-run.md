# Feat: Add default fields for Microsoft Ads

We've improved the **Microsoft Ads** connector to help you set up reports faster.

Now, when you select the **User Location Performance Report** or **Campaigns**, we automatically pre-select common useful fields (like *Impressions*, *Clicks*, *Spend*) so you don't have to search for them.

* **Convenient:** Standardization of commonly used metrics.
* **Flexible:** You can still uncheck these fields if you don't need them.
