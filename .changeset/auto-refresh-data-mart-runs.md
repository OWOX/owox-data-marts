# Enhanced Data Mart run history monitoring with automatic updates

Improved the overall experience when working with Data Mart by introducing automatic data refresh and better run handling:

**Automatic data updates:**
- Run history now automatically refreshes, keeping you informed about the latest execution status
- Google Sheets reports automatically update with fresh data without manual page refresh
- Auto-refresh can be toggled on/off in run history, with your preference saved for future sessions
- Updates happen silently in the background without disrupting your work

**Better connector run experience:**
- Clear loading indicators when manually running connectors, with the ability to cancel
- Improved error messages when attempting to run a connector that's already in progress
- No more technical error messages - you'll see friendly notifications like "Connector is already running. Please wait until it finishes"

These improvements ensure you always have up-to-date information about your Data Mart executions without needing to manually refresh the page.
