# Added instant health status indicators to the Data Marts list

Improved Data Marts list with instant health status indicators and automatic prefetching of recent run data, making it easier to monitor Data Mart health at a glance.

- **Color-coded health status indicators** for each Data Mart  
  (success, failure, mixed results, in progress, or no recent runs)
- **Draft Data Marts** clearly communicate that publishing is required before runs are available
- **Automatic prefetching** of run statuses for visible rows — no waiting, no hover-to-load surprises
- **Helpful hover details** with recent run info and a quick path to full Run History
