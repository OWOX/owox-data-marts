# Switch between projects in the app ✨

You can now quickly switch between your projects right from the sidebar menu. This makes it easier to:

- Move between workspaces without signing out
- Keep your context while browsing different projects
- Access project-specific data and settings faster

No setup required — just open the project switcher and choose the project you need.
