# Sort runs in notification emails by time (newest first)

Previously, runs in notification emails appeared in the order they were added to the queue, which could result in non-chronological ordering (e.g., 2:48, 3:02, 3:03). Now runs are sorted by finished time in descending order, so the most recent runs appear first.
