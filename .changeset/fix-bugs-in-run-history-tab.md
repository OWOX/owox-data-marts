# Fix bugs in data mart run history tab

Fixed bugs that users may have encountered in the Data Mart "Run History" tab, namely:

- Unexpected visual effects when clicking the "Load More" button.
- Automatic deletion of run items that were loaded via the "Load More" button, and displaying only the last 20 runs.
