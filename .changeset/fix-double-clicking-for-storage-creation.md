# Improve Storage Creation UX and Interaction Safety

The Storage creation flow is now smoother and more predictable.

- Added click-lock protection to prevent accidental double-clicks when selecting a Storage type.  
  This prevents duplicate creation requests and ensures users trigger the action only once.

- Buttons now automatically switch to a disabled state while a new Storage is being created.  
  This provides clear visual feedback and blocks unwanted interactions during processing.

These updates improve safety, reduce friction, and help users stay in control while the system handles their request.
