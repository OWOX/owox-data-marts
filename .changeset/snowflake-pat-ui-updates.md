# Update Snowflake storage UI to use PAT terminology

Updated the Snowflake storage settings interface to refer to "PAT (Programmatic Access Token)" instead of "Password" to align with Snowflake's current terminology.

**This is a visual change only.** Your existing configurations remain unchanged, and **no action is required on your part**. Everything will continue to work as before.
